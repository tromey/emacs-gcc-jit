## What it is

This is low-level bindings to gcc-jit for Emacs.  The bindings are
autogenerated using a GCC Python plugin and rely on emacs-ffi.

Note that currently there doesn't seem to be a way to get enum
constants using a Python plugin.  You can get them by applying
a modified version of the patch from
https://github.com/davidmalcolm/gcc-python-plugin/pull/24

## What it isn't yet

There are a few to-do items:

* Write tests.  I haven't actually even tried this yet.

* Add "CFFI-style" type converters to emacs-ffi; then change this to
  use them where appropriate.

* See if there is some way we can do type-checking on this at runtime
  to avoid egregious errors.
